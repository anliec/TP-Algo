Choice of the data structure
Our application must support 20 million events from 1500 sensors. Consequently, we chose not to store event themselves as they arrive. However, at the launch of our program, several static arrays of entire values are created. Their indexes correspond to the information used to anwer to the user querries, for instance the sensor number, the hour,etc. Their last dimension corresponds to a sensor color. So when an event is added, we just increment one cell in each array.


Class DataHandler
All data additions and request are managed by the class DataHandler which contain itself the 4 data arrays.

public methods :
int addData(const Data &data);
int addData(const char &traffic,const uint &min,const uint &hours,const uint &id,const uint &day7);
method used to increment corresponding cells of all arrays.
int sensorStats(usint id);
prints a sensor statistics using the private array uint sensors[NUMBER_OF_SENSORS][NUMBER_OF_COLORS];
int jamStats(uchar day7);
prints jam statistics by hour using the private array uint daysAndHours[NUMBER_OF_DAYS][NUMBER_OF_HOURS][NUMBER_OF_COLORS];
int dayStats(uchar day7);
prints a week day statistics using the private array uint days[NUMBER_OF_DAYS][NUMBER_OF_COLORS];



Class IdHash
The user can only declare 1500 sensors but their id is not necessarily below 1500. As the DataHandler only computes sensors with a number between 0 and 1499 (for instance for some indexes in our static arrays), we use the IdHash to link the real id of a sensor to its virtual number.

public methods :
void addId(const unsigned & id);
unsigned getTabId(const unsigned & id) const;



Document of test description

We used a few manually generated test and we generated some bigger input files with a generation code. This script also generates an expected output file.

To test or application, we made it read the input file instead of the keyboard input. We also redirect the application output to another file which is afterwards compared to the expected output file.

generation methods :

int generateTest2();
generates entries (all green) for 1500 sensors and a restricted time interval. Calls JAM_DH query to test input values. Used to check that the program runs.
int generateTest3();
generates entries for 50 sensors but in bigger time intervals and multiple traffics. Calls the 3 different queries with several parameters. Used o check that the program computes datas properly.
int generateTest4();
generates some entries to test basically if the last query works with some missing values. Fast to check.
int generateTest5();
Our biggest test. ~20M events on 1500 sensors. To compare with outputs from other groups. Sensor numbers between 0 and 1G

Moreover, we used some manually wrote tests to try to check all special conditions for our queries.
